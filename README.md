# HELMET-DETECTION-IN-TRAFFIC-
Helmet Detection in Traffic. A real-time helmet detection web app built using Python and Flask, integrated with HTML/CSS for the frontend and a PHP-based login system. The login page connects to PHPMyAdmin (MySQL) to securely store and manage user data. The system uses a YOLO-based model to detect helmets in live webcam feeds.
