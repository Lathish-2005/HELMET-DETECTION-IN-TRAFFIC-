# HELMET-DETECTION-IN-TRAFFIC-
Helmet Detection in Traffic. A real-time helmet detection web app built using Python and Flask, integrated with HTML/CSS for the frontend and a PHP-based login system. The login page connects to PHPMyAdmin (MySQL) to securely store and manage user data. The system uses a YOLO-based model to detect helmets in live webcam feeds.

 Technologies Used:
Python & Flask ‚Äì Backend and model integration

OpenCV & YOLO ‚Äì Helmet detection via webcam

HTML/CSS ‚Äì Frontend design

PHP & MySQL (PHPMyAdmin) ‚Äì User authentication and database

JavaScript ‚Äì Frontend interactivity

üîê Features:
Real-Time Detection: Uses a YOLO-based model to detect helmets in live video streams.

User Authentication: A login system built using PHP, connected to MySQL via PHPMyAdmin.

Database Integration: User login data and access records are securely stored and managed.

Web Interface: Simple, responsive UI for authorized users to access detection results.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning, web development, and database systems to build a practical safety tool.

NOTE: CHANGE THE NAME OF THE DATABASE YOU CREATED IN PHPMYADMIN IN THE PHP SERVER CODE,
